# Yasir Ali  
**Full-Stack Developer | Next.js · TypeScript · JavaScript AI**

I build production-ready web applications using **Next.js and TypeScript**, with a focus on clean architecture, performance, and maintainable code.  
My AI work is done entirely in **JavaScript/TypeScript**, integrating LLMs directly into real-world web products.

## 🧠 What I Work On

- ⚙️ Full-stack applications with **Next.js (App Router)**
- 🧩 Backend APIs using **Node.js and Express**
- 🗄️ Production databases with **PostgreSQL and MongoDB**
- 🎨 Modern UI systems using **Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui**
- 🤖 AI-powered features using **JavaScript-based LLM SDKs**

## 🤖 JavaScript-Based AI Experience

- OpenAI API integration using **Node.js**
- Streaming AI responses in Next.js applications
- Server-side prompt handling and safety constraints
- Early-stage **RAG-style patterns implemented in JavaScript**
- Exploring **LangChain.js** for agent-style workflows

> No Python-based AI pipelines. All AI integrations are built in JS/TS.
