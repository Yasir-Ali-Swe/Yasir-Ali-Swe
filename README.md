# Yasir Ali  
**Full-Stack Developer | Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript AI**

I build production-ready web applications using **Next.js and TypeScript**, with an emphasis on clean architecture, performance, and maintainable codebases.  
My AI work is done entirely in **JavaScript/TypeScript**, integrating LLMs directly into real-world web products.

---

## What I Work On

- Full-stack applications with **Next.js (App Router)**
- Backend APIs using **Node.js and Express**
- Production databases with **PostgreSQL and MongoDB**
- Modern UI systems using **Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui**
- AI-powered features using **JavaScript-based LLM SDKs**

---

## JavaScript-Based AI Experience

- OpenAI API integration in **Node.js**
- Streaming AI responses in Next.js applications
- Server-side prompt handling and safety constraints
- Early-stage **RAG patterns implemented in JavaScript**
- Exploring **LangChain.js** for agent-style workflows

> No Python-based AI pipelines. All AI integrations are built in JS/TS.

## How I Think About Code

- Clarity over cleverness
- APIs before UI
- Explicit types and predictable data flow
- Features are not done until they are usable
